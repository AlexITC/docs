# Minting

*Coming soon…*

This page is not ready yet but we’re working hard on documenting it. Check back a bit later.

In the meantime, you can learn more about Candy Machine V3 via the following resources:

- [Candy Machine Core Program documentation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/candy-machine-core/program)
- [Candy Guard Program documentation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-candy-guard)

Thank you!
